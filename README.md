# irLib Arduino Library

This is the code used to pulse an infrared led at 38 kHz. It uses PWM on pin 3 of
the ATmega328P. The code can be adapted to be used on other Atmel microcontrollers.

This code was taken from Ken Shirriff ![alt text](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote). All I did 
was take out the parts I didn't need for this project, whch slimmed down the code significantly.

I used an Arduino UNO to program the microcontroller in the Arduino IDE. The folder irLib can be imported as
a library in the Arduino IDE.
